#### Why Clients Will Choose ME Over Any Other Web Developer

- **You wake up tomorrow with a real, live, public website already online** – no waiting weeks, no back-and-forth, no “learning curve”. I deliver it 100 % ready in 24–48 hours.
- **Zero recurring costs forever**: no hosting bills, no WordPress updates, no plugin subscriptions. GitHub Pages = free for life.
- **You keep 100 % ownership and control** – everything lives in your own GitHub account (not mine, not some shady agency server).
- **I set it up so you never touch code again if you don’t want to**. You just open Obsidian (the app you probably already love) → write or drag-and-drop → save → your site updates automatically in seconds.

#### Why Obsidian Is the Perfect Brain for Your Website

- You already think in notes and links – Obsidian is **the best tool on earth** for that.
- **Write once, publish everywhere**: the same vault becomes your personal knowledge base AND your public website.
- **Beautiful typography, instant search, tags, backlinks, graph view** – all work on the live site with zero extra plugins.
- Works offline, syncs with your phone, **supports folders, images, PDFs, embeds, everything** you already use.
- **Future-proof**: if you ever outgrow it, your content is just Markdown files – you can move anywhere tomorrow.

#### Why GitHub + GitHub Pages Beats Every Other Option

| What People Usually Pay For        | Monthly Cost  | Your Cost With My Service |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Shared hosting + WordPress         | $5–30/mo      | **$0 forever**            |
| Netlify / Vercel (free tier)       | $0–20/mo      | **$0 forever**            |
| Custom domain (you bring it)       | $12/year      | Same $12/year             |
| Security updates, backups, plugins | Hours of work | Handled automatically     |

- GitHub Pages is powered by the same infrastructure that runs millions of sites – **rock-solid, globally fast, HTTPS by default.**
- **Automatic HTTPS certificate, automatic scaling, 99.99 % uptime** – better than most paid hosts.
- **Built-in version history**: break something? Just click “revert” in GitHub. No backups to manage.

#### Why So Incredibly Cheap ($5–10 range)

Because I’m not selling you hosting, servers, or my time forever.  
I’m selling you one afternoon of my expertise **to save you 50+ hours of frustration and hundreds of dollars per year.**

Most freelancers charge $300–$1500 for a custom static site.  
I charge less than a dinner for two because:

- The entire stack is free (GitHub + Obsidian + open-source themes)
- I reuse the same bulletproof template (customized for you in minutes)
- *==**My mission is to get as many people as possible publishing this way – the lower the price, the more lives I change.**==*

#### Who This Is Perfect For (make them see themselves)

- **Writers** who are tired of Medium taking their traffic
- **Researchers & students** who want a beautiful public vault
- Indie hackers needing a landing page or documentation site
- **Consultants wanting a clean portfolio** without the bloat
- **Anyone** who believes their notes deserve to be seen by the world

If you’ve ever thought “**I wish my Obsidian notes could just be my website**” – this gig turns that wish into reality tomorrow morning.

**Ready**? Send me your GitHub username (or say “create one for me”) and the site name you want.  
I’ll handle everything else and hand you the keys to your new permanent corner of the internet.

# Click “Order Now” and tomorrow you’ll have a real website that updates every time you click a button in Obsidian.
